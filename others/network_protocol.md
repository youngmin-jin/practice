# Network Protocol
- mechanism or a set of procedures that enables devices to communicate back and forth across the internet
- in order to communicate together, two devices must support the same protocol or a gateway will be needed to translate the communication
<br/>

### Network management protocols
- designed to help manage and troubleshoot performance
- set out policies designed to monitor, manage, and maintain a network
- e.g., SNMP, FTP, POP3..
<br/>

### Network communication protocols
- designed to enable two devices to exchange data
- to establish rules and formatting (e.g., syntax, synchronization, and semantics) for exchanging data across a network
- e.g., TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP..
  > TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)/ IP (Internet Protocol)
  >  - most widely used
  >  - converts data into packets so they can be sent btw a server and a client
  >  - transfer files, text, images.. it guarantees that the packets will be delivered accurately and in the correct order
  >  - under the traditional TCP/IP model of networking, IP is used alongside TCP to identify hosts to send data across the internet

  > HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
  >  - enables systems to communicate on the World Wide Web
  >  - a client will send a hypertext msg request to a web server asking for access to the resources needed to load a web page
<br/>

### Network security protocols
- use security measures (e.g., cryptography, encryption) to protect data
- e.g., HTTPS, SFTP, SSL.. <br/><br/>
  > HTTPS
  >  - encrypted version of HTTP
  >  - uses SSL/TLS encryption to encrypt requests and responses so not accessed by third parties
  >  - e.g., REQUEST, RESPONSE
<br/>
